# Advent Of Code ðŸŽ„

These are my attempts at the Adcent of Code [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## Project Structure

```
<year>/<day>/input.txt - Prompt
<year>/<day>/index.ts - Solution
<year>/<day>/index.spec.ts - Test
```

## ðŸš€ Getting started

install all required dependencies with `bun install`

Create a new day with `bun run create <year>/<day>`

Get a solution with `bun run solve <year>/<day>`, or in watchmode: `bun run solve:watch <year>/<day>`.

Run tests `bun test`
